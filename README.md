### What is is

Better Text Viewer is a lightweight Chrome extension that facilitates reading plain-text files in Chrome. Get the same view of your file that you would in Notepad++, Vim, or any other decent text editor, including:

- Line numbering
- Line unwrapping
- Syntax highlighting

The extension automatically determines when you are viewing a plain-text file, and guesses the language based on the file extension-- no configuration necessary. 

### How it works

Better Text Viewer is open source and is powered by the [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor.
